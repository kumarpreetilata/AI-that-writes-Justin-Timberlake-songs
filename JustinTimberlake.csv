Justin Timberlake,3-Way (The Golden Rule),"Yeah
Backin' that ass
Your mom says ""Hi"" — Jinx!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah no no

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex

You know I just got a page from a girl that I met last week at the Payless
Shoe stores

I also have a cutie to call who likes the way I knock on her boots

Well let's help them back
Let's handle that
In two-to-six hours,
We'll meet back here and regroup

Now let's shoop

Roll up to her crib with some Bartles & James
Hop off the bus with the Alizé
Now hold up player, whatchu diggity-doing here?
I should diggity-ask you the same
And she sang

Hey, boys I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool

(Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together
She forgot about the Golden Rule — a huh huh

It's OK to put us in a three-way
It's not gay when it's in a three-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a one, two, three-way

Normally, I don't get down with dudes
But tonight is a special exception (Great)
See you're my best friend
Through thick and thin
Now it's time to make a triple connection

Lights off

Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's so hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Ew wee)
This rule dates back (The Golden Rule)
To ancient Greece (Takin' about Cesar)
We're two Jack Trippers and a Chrissy
The new Three's Company

You guys are still here.

It's OK to put us in a three-way
It's not gay when it's in a three-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a one, two three-way

Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick
Helicopter dick, go! Hellicopter dick. Helicopter dick
To impress a chick
Helicopter dick

And all of that was OK
'Cuz it was in a three-way
It's right there when you see the instant replay (boom)
Maybe two is enough
That's what they'll say
But we'll say, ""Hell no.""
It's a one, two, three-way

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

The golden rule "

Justin Timberlake,(Another Song) All Over Again,"Oh, yeah
You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool
In so many ways
But I would change my life
If you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance
To write you another song
Take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just
Please, give me another chance
To write you another song
Take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again
Ooh
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life (yes I would)
If you would let me try to love you
So please give me another chance
To write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again
Again, oh
No no
Oh oh
You know I love you (yeah)
Give me one more chance
No no
No no no no"
Justin Timberlake,Ayo Technology,"Something special, unforgettable,
50 Cent (cent), Justin (tin), Timbaland (land), god damn (damn)
She she, she want it, I want to give it to her
She know that, it's right here for her
I want to, see you break it down
I'm ballin', throwin' money around
She work it girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she about the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money money, she makin' makin'
Look at the way she shakin' shakin'
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
She know's just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop
She always ready, when you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I show you where to meet her
On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin'
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want
Baby this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology

Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it shake, the way she make it pop
Make it rain for us so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In her fantasy, there's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
What should I do, one thing on all fours
Now that that shit should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down)
You know I like, when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl you got me thinking about, all the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Baby this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Justin Timberlake,Blindness,"Why can't I see you?
Stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you?
I've been struck by blindness
I close my eyes cause you've been gone
Such a long time I fantasize
You close so long fantasy
Began to see it altered my mind
Am I crazy?
When I open my eyes
The world was gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold
Tell me why can't I see you?
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you?
I've been struck by blindness
If I close my eyes and concentrate
You illuminate your brightest light
And I let you go
The worst mistake it's clear as day
But I can't wrap my mind around it baby
And when I open my eyes
The world is gone, long gone, long gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold
Tell me why can't I see you?
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you?
I've been struck by blindness
Oh, tell me why can't I see you?

Justin Timberlake,Blue ocean floor,"Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out it's glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
20, 000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor"

Justin Timberlake,Brand New,"My love, ooo
My love
A winner never quits
And a quitter never wins
I thought about what I wanted
And you were on my list
Remember where I was?
In the desert with no love
No cactus's, just dust
And you swept me from above
My love
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
'Cause it is so good
Good
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new
You got me feelin' brand new
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
My love, ooo
My love
Life to me is easy
People make it complicated
When love is the tool
No reason we can't make it
Come on, let's go, be brave
Feel somethin' at the [?]
Once we know that amaze
Then give it all the way
My love
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
'Cause it is so good

Got the tags still on me, oh
Listen, all my life, when I describe
What I want, I've been misunderstood
The more I try, at bein' satisfied
And didn't think that I could
But then you came along, and you made me strong
Like God said you would
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
'Cause it is so good
Good

Justin Timberlake,Breeze Off the Pond,"Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Grass is greenest when you're here with me, okay, mmm
If what they got is all good then why would they trade
No we are in the zone and we ain't gonna let it go, no way
(No we ain't gonna let it go, gonna let it go)
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah
While we're canoeing stoned as Tiny Dancer plays
Huff and puff all they want, but this house isn't made of straw or clay
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away
Like a breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
You and I against the world, against the world, against the world
You and I against the world, and everything it comes with
No denying what you're worth, what you're worth, what you're worth
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I'm a star, you should keep it low
Nuh uh want a bit more space, with a big 'ole sign you can see from the highway
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I'm a star, you should keep it low
Nuh uh want a bit more space, with a big 'ole sign you can see from the highway

Justin Timberlake,Cabaret,"Hey, hey, hey

Now can we discuss
How fast you just got undressed
Girl if sex is a contest then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow
No I can't lie, I'm impressed
And no impatient encore
When love curtains close
It's a cabaret

Cause even though I'm a professional
I like to do my work at home
Cabaret

You giving me everything you got
All I really want now is more

Say my name, do you know

We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya

So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya
Girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control

I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep it soul stripping things slipping like a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O.
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

Justin Timberlake,casanova,"It's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
He said he's busy and he'd call me but he never called me back (no)
And now I feel like somethings going on
But I feel crazy every time I bring it up so I don't
He told me there's no one above me
And all my friends are telling me different and something seems funny
tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
I can still hear voices in my head like
I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part
Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know hey)
I shoulda never given into his games
Shoulda only been the type that treat me the same
And it ain't fair coz I gave him all I had now there's nothing left
(these tears wil dry and you'll move on, on and on and on)
This songs the same thing
Can't keep fallin'
No more heartbreak
tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
Coz I still hear everybody's voice like
I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on you
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part
Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)
and so I cry cry cry
Ask myself why why why
And that I cry cry cry
So why should I try try try
and so I cry cry cry (hey)
Ask myself why why why (sometimes it has to be this way)
And that I cry cry cry (hey)
So why should I try try try
and I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)

Justin Timberlake,chop me up,"It's going down
Tennessee, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Three 6 Mafia
Tennessee
VA, dirty south, dirty south
It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do
Project shit what
I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around, and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends, and y'all can come to the back, oh, oh
Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh
And when I call, don't give me the run around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl
There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but, girl, you don't hear me
Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady
Come on and don't
(Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby
C'mon, girl, don't
(Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
You're kinda cute
Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around?
If you gotta problem, baby, I can hold ya down
I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby make your first wish
You the party, baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless
So grab your friends and let's take it back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(Parental discretion is advised) Oh, oh
Y'all can be the star in my freaky spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me
Little lady
You got me just

Off of your melody
Little lady
C'mon and don't

Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady
You got me just

Off of your melody
Easy, baby
Come on, girl, don't
(Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
See, girl, you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?""
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah
They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey
Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady
Come on and don't

Please don't make a fool of me

Justin Timberlake,cry me a river,"You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say that somethings are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river
Oh!
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh!
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh!
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh!
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (you can go on and just)
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (oh, baby, cry)
Cry me a river (I don't wanna cry no more)
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)"

Justin Timberlake,dead and gone,"Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit
Man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic
Situation coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey"

In the speed round
Got a holiday you're gonna
Like better stick around
Well my favorite's a ""Big Hug Ball Day""
That's a big ball of hugs
Or ""Shock A Friend Day""
Rub your feet on the rug
And touch everyone you love
Well, there's a very special day
We call an ""equinox""
It's a great opportunity
to celebrate socks
Socks socks socks so-so-Socks!
Come on!
Tear Away Pants Day
feel the breeze on your hips
Hear the sound a Velcro
going rip rip rip
Good Luck Troll Day
Put a gem on your stomach
And you spit a little charm
Let a friend belly rub it
Rub rub rub rub rub rub...
Everyone will be so jelly
When they see you on the telly
With their shiny big jewels
sticking right out your belly
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Come on!

On Express Yourself Day
Give your opinion a shout
Keep It To Yourself Day
Where you shut your mouth
There's a rockin' holiday
Filled up with lots of drama
Get you jumpin' all around

Shoot a flare in the air
Like you just don't care
'Cause it's ""Fireworks Day""
In the village square
There's ""Bleeping Sound Day""
Where you only speak in bleeps
You could say anything like:
If you want a tattoo,
But you're having doubts
There's ""Random Tattoo Day""
Which is not thought out
Smacksgiving Day is a day we embrace
Especially when someone
gets slapped in the face
A big holiday that's a bundle of fun
It's Fuzzy Wuzzy Day so go put one on
It's so wuzzy and it's fuzzy
And it's cute and ugly fugly
And we know you're gonna love it
When you're feeling super snuggly

Hips so wide, looks like it's got whiskers
Let put a solid gold on that solid figure
Go ahead show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
I'm pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest, but I'm the only thing that's missing

Justin Timberlake,drink you away,"Bitter sweet thing
Could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain
A tall shot of pain
Pour a little OUT now for the love that we've made
I feel it in the morning
You're still here in the morning
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof
Don't change the truth
I dive in but I can't
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks
I can't swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in
Say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break, oh?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heart break?
Got a pounding on my brain
So I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doing the same
'Cause I just can't forget
The way we turned out this bad/bed
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
And then I feel it in the morning
You're still here in the morning
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: I'm not okay
Bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof
Don't change the truth
I dive in but I can't
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away (no, I can't)

Tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break?
Oh, tell me, baby, one time, come on, don't they make a medicine for heart break?
Break it down
I can't drink you No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you I can't drink you away, away

Justin Timberlake,Electric Lady,"What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady
Oh my, you're skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said that I want you to ignite fires all night
And you got the power
You're damn right
It's life or death
Not gonna make it if you don't connect tonight right
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You're reaching my heart fast
You're searching for something
That's just how electricity behaves
Now we're needing it so bad
The other ones don't last
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it 'til it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops
I feel it jump, we get closer 'til we shock
You turn it on and I touch it 'til it sparks
Electric lady

Justin Timberlake,Flannel,"Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on)
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I was a stan
I was leavin' with my flannel on
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone again
And I pledge these arms and chest are here
To hold you in from the cold
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it (the way you wear it)
It takes your shape while you keep it on (all you gotta do is keep it on)
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?"

I, i'm not sure just how to say this for you
The words just don't come out right
But that doesn't mean that i don't feel somethin' for ya
You gotta understand that love
Love was something i knew nothing about
Until i met you
But you, girl
You're the one that turned my heart around
And for that i love you

My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oh damn i'm mesmerized
I'm floatin' on the sky
Girl you're making me high
My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oh damn i'm mesmerized
I tried everything i knew from before
She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
I'm on cloud nine and i want some more
She got me floatin'

Say do do do do do do
If you're in love let me hear you say do do, do do, do do do do do

I can feel my heart fall to the ground
And for that i love you
I'm walking on the sky

Girl you got me walkin' on the sky
Sho' nuff make a brother feel high
And it feels like i'm floatin'

One day i hope you could tell me why
Why the sun don't shine when you're gone
Baby, you've still got that thing to turn me on
Like the first time i peeped ya
I wanted to freak ya
And getcha up outta your thong
I wanna freak ya, freak ya, freak freak ya
Get kinky, put your booty on a speaker
And when my waist go boom
And the bass go boom
Can i se-quence the beat to treat ya?
'cause it's seven in the morning and it just don't stop
And we've been at it since eleven o'clock
The chocolate rabbit with the hippity hop
Makin' love letcha flow
I tried everything i knew from before
She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
I'm on cloud nine and i want some more
She got me floatin'
I had to say do do, do do, do do do do do do

Justin Timberlake,Follow my head,"One, two, two, three, three, uhh, hands up

Everybody knows this is the anthem
Everybody knows this is the anthem
So get your hands up, go

[Verse 1: Esmée Denters]
You don't feel love from nobody
And brand new problems keep coming
They follow you, you keep running
So down boy, don't you hear something?
Gone through it if you just listen
It might just make you look different
Just let it go, you won't miss it
Nothing to lose, just go with it

[Pre-Chorus: Esmée Denters]
What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me
What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me

[Chorus: Esmée Denters]
Follow my lead
And we'll go where no one goes
When everyone leaves
I'll be the one still standing strong
Listen to me, love is a song
I'll be the melody, you'll be my drum
Follow my lead and we'll go where no one goes

[Verse 2: Esmée Denters]
The world around you keeps changing
Come back to what you keep waiting
For something to come and save you
Just let it in, let it take you
To a place where every thing's better
'Cause you've been waiting forever
Live life like it don't matter
It won't stop if you don't let it

[Pre-Chorus: Esmée Denters]
What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me

It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me

How many of us have them?
Friends
Ones you can depend on
You just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Lean on me
You just might have a problem
That I'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
Thank you for being a friend
(You know this one)
Traveled down the road and back again
Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant
And if you threw a party
Invited everyone you knew
Well you would see
The biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
Thank you for being a friend
Oh you're the best friend
That I've ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
My feelings are true

Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain
Sorry show it for the whole crowd

Justin Timberlake,give it to me,"Is it going? Is it going
Is it going? Is it going
I don't know what you're looking for
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as they come, if you don't know why - I'm fly-why-why
I seen you try to switch it up, but girl you ain't got those
I'm the wonderwoman. Let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy, sÃ­ mommy
Amnesty International got bankrupt. I'm on top, on lock
Love my ass and my abs and the video called Promiscuous
My style is ridi-di-diculous-ulous-ulous
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mil for my beats. You get a couple gra-a-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your song gonna top the charts. I heard em, I'm not a fa-a-a-an
Niggas talking greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell them that they can't do it like I can
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Could you speak up and stop m-m-mumbling
I don't think you're getting clear
If you're sitting on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you trying to act cute on TV, just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-I-it
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over, not at least until we say
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

I just noticed that she was looking at me
Chill homeboy be cool
Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
Its just gettin' started
And there's a lot of fish around
Here just shakin' they jelly
I ain't tryin' to be rude dude but we tryin' to tear up the place come on
There ain't nothing to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it-do it
There ain't nothing to it
Get out your seat
Why
You ain't glued to it
Be easy and watch that, tone
Keep stepping with your new suede shoes, on
Boys and girls lets all sing along
Now everybody just get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
Now, how am I supposed to know that she's yours
She ain't got no ring on her finger
It ain't our fault homeboy that your girl likes to wonder and linger
Your actin' so serious
We just danced I ain't even ask for her number
Don't be mad 'cause we the life of the party
We ain't tryin' to hurt nobody talk to 'em
I'm not being cocky
I just noticed that she was looking at me
Chill homeboy be cool
Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
Its just gettin' started
And there's a lot of fish around
Here just shakin' they jelly
I ain't tryin' to be rude dude
But we tryin' to tear up the place
Come on
There ain't nothing to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it, do it
There ain't nothing to it
Get out your seat
Why
You ain't glued to it
Be easy and watch that, tone
Keep stepping with your new suede shoes, on
Boys and girls lets all sing along
Now everybody just get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
If you keep on pressin' at me
(That don't bother me none)
Cause I see every fish in the sea
(Ima get the baddest one)
You take yourself so seriously
(But you don't impress me none)
Don't be alarmed boy, we came to do no harm boy
Talk to 'em
I'm not being cocky
I just noticed that she was looking at me
Chill homeboy be cool
Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
Its just gettin' started
And there's a lot of fish around
Here just shakin' they jelly
I ain't tryin' to be rude dude
But we tryin' to tear up the place
Come on

Justin Timberlake,halleujah,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
"
Justin Timberlake,the hard stuff,"So give me the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Ooh, yeah
Anybody can be in love on a sunny day
Anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue
But that ain't the kind of love I'm lookin' to have with you
So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Yeah I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah)
My god knows I'm not the man that I want to be
And we all know there's things in this life we refuse to see
So just know my fire for you will always burn
And please forgive the things in this life that I have to learn
So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, oh)
No, we won't have to wonder
Oh, you won't have to wonder
If we're ever goin' under
No, we're never goin' under
No, we're never goin' under
'Cause I want the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
Cut each other to the bone (break each other to the bone)
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, oh)
Yeah I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah)
Yeah I want the hard stuff
Give me the hard stuff
Yeah I want the, mmm mm, I want the hard stuff
So give me the hard stuff"

I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another lover
Stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, and money is fine
But you're special, another level
I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say what's up
We both danced to ""Lucky Star""
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
You were that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

Justin Timberlake,holy grail,"You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love it so much, yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Uh, Blue told me remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y'all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
Bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, mama please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just entertainers
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit just ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
Still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
You get the air out my lungs, whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleeding, I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Don't know why"
Justin Timberlake,hoonanny,"I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport
'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for______________________________?
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ??
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck___? is all that's glistenin'
Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt
Y'all matter less everytime this margarita tilt

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear
Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer
And another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary
In due time, but there's business left to attend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another ? before my great aunt Missy
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen???

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny...

Yo
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time
You know this ain't a pick up line

Well don't just sit there girl

And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing a girl will be there
Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for
Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right
In your eyes I see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby
Pharrell say don't do it the same
But I say I ain't playing my games
But for you my soul still remains
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby
Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused

Justin Timberlake,lets take a ride,"Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything baby
Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mami that place isn't worth your tears
(Oh, oh)
I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
Girl you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me
(Woo)
Try to change what you can
And accept all the things you cannot
(Don't stress yourself baby)
I know you want to fly away from the world
But for now with the time we've got
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby I know just what you need
(I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea
It hurts me to watch you sing the blues
(It hurts me baby)
Girl you're so confused
(Let's get away)
And I know what to do
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
(Let's take a ride)
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

Justin Timberlake,like i love you,"Just something about you
The way I'm lookin' at you whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny
It feel good right?
Listen
I kind of noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
See people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl
Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""how the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a alike
You have me sleepin in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots let it burn in your chest
We could ride down pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number 3, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I
Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (hey!)
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance"
Justin Timberlake,livin off the land,"You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is
There's you and nature
You think you got it all figured out, you know
The wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson
As I'm alone in the forest I'm in one with my surroundings
And there's a lot of peace in that solitude
I'll be a mountain man 'til the day I die
And I break my back
And I work all night
At times I do all their work too
It don't break my stride
I just keep moving forward
At times I wish there was two
So I have somebody else that could help me help you
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit card
She keep on threatenin' to leave
If you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gambling it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search, singing
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Why you waste what you ain't got
On that Power Ball
Has it not quite dawned on you, that don't work at all
See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing for you
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit card
She keep on threatenin' to leave
If you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gambling it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search, singing
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit card
She keep on threatenin' to leave
If you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gambling it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna' soul search, singing
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)
If you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)
You'll see, you got what you need
When you're living off the land"
Justin Timberlake,loose ends,"Dear mom, Alana's in her second trimester
Stressed out 'cause I'm gone, she acting all extra
We're happy 'cause she knows it's a girl
But we doubtful if we should bring another one in the world
An' the pic you sent with you, and the kids is da bomb
I'm keepin' all my photos in my 23rd Psalm
My best friend Armani lost her arm at the border
Just tryin' to restore a little peace and order
An' it's strange 'cause she reads the Koran
Torn between what side she needs to be on
Haven't slept for days, I squeeze Visine
'Cause no man's eyes should see what I've seen
Soldiers lost their mind, robbin', pillagin'
Tomahawk missiles into civilian villages
And they ease the pain with narcotics
I'm scared but I'm tryin' to remain patriotic
My father, forgive us
'Cause we know not what we doin'
And my brothers, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'
And my mother, tryin' to use
Ev'rything you taught me to keep it movin'
And my brothers and sisters, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'
New message from mom, at Bringbackthetroopsdot.com
At home they 'Nam, so sad you had to miss Shavonne's prom
Just some songs off the Marvin Gaye 'what's Going On' album
And her smile lit up the room
She asks me if at night when she stares at the moon
Is it possible at the same moment of time
You're starin' as well' 'Cause you two were in tune
Your dad's Purple Heart now hangs over his ashes
An' Trini's alive and wake up with hot flashes
They say the disease's gastric
Have yet to explain the migraines and rashes
And have you seen what the price of gas is'
We can't afford the property taxes
We just want you back at home
Where you belong with your family
You're the backbone
My father, forgive us
'Cause we know not what we doin'
And my brothers, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'
And my mother, tryin' to use
Ev'rything you taught me to keep it movin'
And my brothers and sisters, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'
Tell me how can we live this way
We've gone so far astray, no one knows what to say
We got young peoples lives at stake
What is it gonna take for us to find a way'
The world is changin', we in danger
'Cause we ain't changin our behavior
We behave like calm is nothing
Ain't concerned with repercussions, ain't that somethin'
Check 'em out now, pointin' fingers
When they know how we got to this point of terror
Precaution could have made the road clearer
But we stuck with mediocre leadership
So we'll just suffer
Who knows what the hell is going on
With conflicts they keep on growing
It's a fucked up situation
When you ain't got no education
On the problem or know what it's about
You gotta help me out"
Justin Timberlake,losing my way,"Hey, excuse me
Hi, my name is Bob, and I work at my job
I make forty-something dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Till I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped out of school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See, I can't put down the pipe
And it's breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down
No more friends around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I would have done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See, I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is
I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes
And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down
No more friend around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Oh my god, please forgive me
(Father, hear my prayer)
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
If I could do it all again
Have just one more chance
To take all those wrongs and make them right
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?"

Justin Timberlake,lovestoned,"Hey!
She's freaky, and she knows it
She's freaky, and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be going home with me tonight
She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's going home with me tonight
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
She's freaky, and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's going home with me tonight
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's going home with me tonight
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere, and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned, and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh"
Justin Timberlake,make it right,"I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
Little baby with the sun dress on
Looking so damn right you're wrong
Make me want to write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you
Your wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went berserk
Gotta give it to you girl you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm
Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind
So baby tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along
Baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
(You might be right for me)
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
(Yea, yea, work that thing right)
Yea, Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up huntin' 'betty' with Justin and them
We must be the fliest of southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy don't fumble it then
You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend it's your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even want to finish the song, let's go
I'm gettin' discouraged with her
Too late now her friend, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her, not me
I bet you remember the night
Good ol' Bubba K came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right
Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
(Make sure it's right for me, yea)
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
(Work that thing right, yea)

Justin Timberlake,man of the woods,"I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Say ""Where's the faucet?""
Someone's knocking like they know but
Baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
Well I got your sweet little twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice because you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree, they don't understand
You're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Say ""Where's the faucet?""
Someone's knocking like they know but
Baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching

I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
How do I even explain what I've got with you
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody will ever understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me, 'cause there's only one me and you, yeah
There's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand

Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face

Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day

Justin Timberlake,mirrors,"Aren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror
And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you looking back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are
You are you are the love of my life
You are you are the love of my life

Justin Timberlake,money,"Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me

It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
And I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
Now if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you"

Justin Timberlake,motherlover,"Oh dang.
What is it dawg?
I forgot it's Mothers Day.
Didn't get a gift for her.
Other plans got in the way.
She'll be so disappointed.
Damn I forgot it too.
This could have been avoided.
What the hell are we gonna do?
My moms been so forlorn ever since my daddy left.
Cold.
No one to hold her tight.
Life has put her to the test.
I know just what you mean,
My moms been so sad and gray.
Word
My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away.
Hold up!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too.
Slow up!
What time is it dawg?
It's time for a switcharoo
We both love our moms, women with grown women needs

You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each others mothers
Fuck each others moms
Pushin' that place that you came out as a baby

Fuckin' each others moms
'Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
I'm layin' in the cut waitin' for your mom
Clutchin' on this lube and roses

They will be so surprised
We are so cool and thoughtful
Can't wait to pork your mom
I'm gonna be the syrup, she can be my waffle
Sho nuff!
My mother loves bubble bath with chamomile
Straight up!
Give it to my mom d d d d d d doggystyle
This the perfect plan
For a perfect Mothers Day

All up under the covers day
'Cause I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each others mothers
Fuck each others moms
I'm pushin' that lady
Where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
Fuckin' each others moms
Break it down
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
While your in my mother make me another brother.

Justin Timberlake,murder,"Walking around middle of the night
My enemies like with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next to it
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out something might go down
Good I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you speak regular it's freaky girl, I say OK
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chic
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better, better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down to go to that level
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Told yah, ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder"
Justin Timberlake,my kind of girl,"When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart
When you talk. I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby, I'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day
When you talk, I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-
If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (say ""I do"")
Because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
No
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?
Cause girl I've never been more sure (that baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for (just say ""I do"")
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) my love
(So don't give away) ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

No
My love (alright it's time to get it JT)
My love (I don't know what she hesitatin' for man)
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the move once again
But she still has fans from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause your girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
Trust me, you don't really wanna let the chance go by
Cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby France so fly, I can go fly
Private, cause I handle mine
B.I. they call me candle guy(why?) simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart, St. Bulla anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(Love) my love

Justin Timberlake,never again,"Would have given up my life for you
Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face
Lookin' in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do was apologize
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me again
Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine
Loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it
But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me
Wish like Hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late
Its over now
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me again
Again
Again, again, again
Never get to love me"
Justin Timberlake,not a bad thing,"Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
No I won't fill your mind with broken promises
And wasted time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
And I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
Now if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you"
Justin Timberlake,nothing else,"I was just walking that day aimlessly
(Oh, oh no)
You picked a perfect day to bump into me
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason we still met at your store
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
All my friends meet you and say you're the one
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
You had a friend but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads
Please move on with me
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
And that's the way to His kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothin' else in this world
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?
I've been asking everybody what they think
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatums for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'mma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatums or me that's no fun
I was just walking that day aimlessly"
Justin Timberlake,oh no what you got,"You're sneaky
From the corner of my eye I saw you eyeing me
I know that you're watching
Tell me
What would you do if I encouraged you
To get next to me
When nobody's watching
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come off shy now

Passing looks at me

Come over here and get to working
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak

Let's start our own little secrets (Yea)

Justin Timberlake,only when I walk away,"Girl this little game you play
Don't stop 'till you run too far
So what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart
Damn girl, we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn love
Is that shit in sync or insane, love
I guess that's the way we play it
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
What's that, baby, what you say?
You the one to light up this torch
'Cause I'm burning down all the way
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more
Damn love, how did the sound get so amped up
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is that shit insane or in sync, girl
I guess that's the way we play it
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
You should see the look on your face
Baby when I finish what you start
but I can't hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands love
I laid you to rest you said damn love
This shit's insane, it's insane love
Ain't that the way we play it
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not

Justin Timberlake,pair of wings,"If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could fly you away
With a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
And you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you and fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you"

Justin Timberlake,right for me,"I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
Little baby with the sun dress on
Looking so damn right you're wrong
Make me want to write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you
Your wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went berserk
Gotta give it to you girl you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm
Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind
So baby tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along
Baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

Yea, Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up huntin' 'betty' with Justin and them
We must be the fliest of southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy don't fumble it then
You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend it's your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even want to finish the song, let's go
I'm gettin' discouraged with her
Too late now her friend, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her, not me
I bet you remember the night
Good ol' Bubba K came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right
Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

Come here baby, tell me what you doing with him?

You gotta pay attention to me like a symptom
This shit got me amped up, Ritalin
Now don’t be fool, I ball like a Laker
I wipe that smelly shit away like erasers
And I never missed the mark like a maker
But you know I’m from the south, yeah-yer
Maybe me standing here pisses you off
Maybe you should be more like me, involved
I’m going hard like the opposite of soft
Now clap on clap on applause
Maybe you just mad cause I am who you wanna be
Maybe I’m a canvas you paint what you wanna see
Maybe you’re right, maybe I’m an asshole
Oops, did I take it too far? Super Bowl
I’ma still grab my balls, I’m on a roll
Yeah I’m that white boy shooting free throws
Automatic, Kobe but 2 to go
You need a role model, fuck it, you can play the role

Freeze (now put your fingers up)
I got a rocket in my pocket
Everybody on their knees
That means I make the rules so pay attention to me
You don’t want to piss me off
Cause I might fuck around and squeeze
You can get you some of these nuts

Cause I’m going in my own direction
If you don’t like it you can cut your TV off
Do it at your own discretion

I ain’t your mama, your daddy, your granny, cousin or uncle
In fact, I don’t even know you, you follow me on my Twitter
But that don’t mean that you know me
So tell me how did you figured that I’m supposed to be bigger
And try to handle my temper
But if you knew me remember, the 25 of December
When I just happened to reason because I’m the preacher
And yes I’m breaking some habits, no matter how hard you push
You can judge me or love me
Or you can grow you some nuts

He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should arrive
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen
Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my
Ah, ah, arms
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my
Ah, ah, arms
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms
(Oh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'm a sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
And then the ladies go
""I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you""
Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Show the good to me
Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning
That's it"
Justin Timberlake,september,"Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Break it down for me
Say do you remember
Dancing in September
Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September (dancing in September)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Uh huh! (bring it back now)
Come on (bring it back now)
Dancing in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer"
Justin Timberlake,sexy ladies,"Come on
I can tell you want a drink girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dudes don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true
If you know what I'm talking 'bout (hey girl)
Let me see you work it out (hey girl)
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

'Cause the way that you move is so demanding (my love)
Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib, let me ease your soul (my love)

I'm glad you came, let's make a toast (my love)
Let me make an indecent proposal
Let me take you to the back and do what we're suppose to (my love)
Let's take a trip to the bayou
You can be the investigator, I'm your private I (my love)
You know I want a piece of that pie
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

Justin Timberlake,shades,"Uh, before you get here
Put yo panties in yo pocketbook
That's what I told her, over the Motorola
Hennessy and Cola
I hold her, at attention with my mannors
And even though I don't roll a camera
She still performs
Like the superstar, she truly are
So, also I think I love her already
Damn, I think I...already
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun
Even on rainy days, ain't it
Crazy mayne, yeah, that's what I said
She do doughnuts in my head
Over and over, and over
Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick sh*t like
""I'm on my way from Weezy Baby""
And of course they let her go

[Justin Timberlake]
I know I got a lot of baggage
Its for the ladies and mercedes
And I know that it's heavy
But I pray that someone will grab it for me
I know I got a lot of baggage
Full of Chanel's and Tiffany's and broken hearts girl
You need me baby its hard to break a habit
For me yeah

[Diddy]
And girl if you want
I pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
Just to light your cigarette
Girl if you want
(I'll do anything for you)
I'll do anything for you
(I'll even take off my shades)
I'll even take off my shades
And stare right at the sun from the stage
(I'll even try different things)
I'll even try different things
I'll make love to you on marmalade
(never made love on marmalade)
I'll even change my name, name
What you say
(I'll be what ever you say)
I'll be what ever you say
I'll even try different things
I'll make love to you on marmalade
(Are you sure thats what you want to do)
If thats what you want to do

[Chorus]
What you gonna do

What you gonna do
When I'm perfect for you
Girl watch how its gon drive you crazy
And love's gon turn you up baby
Girl watch how its gon drive you crazy
[repeated]

[Diddy]
Got a lot of baggage its full of shades
Different shades
And I'm sharp as a razor thats why I have to brand it
You talking bout me (you talking bout me)
Listen to me
I know I got a lot of baggage
Its full of promises that why I keep a lock on it
I promise girl I'm trying to make it happen for me
And you babe
Now girl if you wanna pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
And light it if you get lonely
If you call me
Girl if you call me
If you want me I'm ready when you are just tell me you want me

[Chorus]
What you gonna do
What you gonna do
When I'm perfect for you
Girl watch how its gon drive you crazy
And love's gon turn you up baby
Girl watch how its gon drive you crazy
[repeated]

[Justin Timberlake]
Black grey white
If I pull down these shades would I sound too bright
Get it, sound too right
Maybe I'm just feeling myself because
""flashing lights come from everywhere""
And you can feel that somethings blowing in the air tonight
Now if you need that fire I'll be that propane
If you need it wet I'll make it pour rain
But maybe I won't
Maybe you just have to take it
Go ahead pretend I'm a drug
Now let me see you shake it
I can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X
We can press rewind, press rewind, VHS
Speaking of the past, its so futuristic behind ya
Let me fill up your plate and dish it out, dish it out, China
I'mma bend yo body, bend yo body, Magneto
Let me have my way, I'mma have my way, Carlito
Now we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you
You ain't never heard you talk like this
It's got my Drizzy on for you"
Justin Timberlake,signs,"I'm not sure what I see

And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)
And her pretty face, drove you wild

Soulmate for the night
Let me put my soul on you, it's only right

Justin Timberlake,still on my brain,"The beautiful days are long gone
And I can't seem to breathe
Feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from meNow I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
I still think of you that way
You should know thatThe beautiful lights, the star-filled nights
They don't mean a thing
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right
Without you here with meNow I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
It's hard for me to say
You were my soulNow I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
I thought that you would never do me that wayBut even after all I still think of you that way
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate waysBut, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now love is a game that we both like to play
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stayEven though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl, you know me inside out
And I can't get you off of my mind
And I could say that I don't love you no moreAnd I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
La, la, la, la
